My implementation of : [powerplant-coding-challenge](https://github.com/gem-spaas/powerplant-coding-challenge)

The application I have develop is based on the .NET Core 5.0  ,  a full Web APi ( Restfull ) 

A ligtweigth applicartion that we deploy in the cloud ( app services or  a aks ) 

# Run and Install the application
The easiest way is to install Visual studio community edition and the just run the app 

## Single Host
### Depedencies
 We need the follolwing package :
  - A Windows , Mac or Linux machine 
  - dotnet core sdk and runtime , version 5.0  ( Cf : [Donwload .Net core runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) )
  - basic knowledge on command line with the dotnet CLI
    
### Command

  - First Donwload this or clone this Project , Open a terminal / Command Prompt
  - `cd Engie-PowerPlant`
  - `dotnet restore`
  -  `dotnet build` 
  -  `dotnet run ( or dotnet watch run)` 
     
## Container
### Depedencies
    On Container , We need  the docker engine present on the machine , docker is running on Linux 
    , Mac and Windows with GUI for some of the them
   [Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
   
   [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install)
    
    
### Command
- Open a command prompt 
- `cd Engie-PowerPlant`
- `docker build -t powerplant.api . `
- `docker run -d -p 8888:8888 --name myapp powerplant.api`


  
# Open API Specification of the application

The app provide API specification for any client implementation : 

- On local `http://localhost:8888/swagger/index.html`
- Route : `/swagger/index.html`

# Technical Approach

The must important factor is  price per MWH   , so we choose as much as posssible the powerplant that produce the cheapest energy.
The final sum of price (  price load = Î£ Pi* Cost i ) shoud be cheapest of all possible case . A kind of mathematicl function with many variables !

But the critera are : 

- Considering their efficiency ( less efficient will cost more )
- Include Co2 allowance price in the price 
- Consider the Pmin constraint : We need only to produce energy that match exaclty the load , no wast 
- Windturbine , Solar energy and renewable depend on external factors ( weather , sun power , temperature ) 


1 - Order by cheaeast price ( unclude C02 price) 
2-  Order by Pmin 
3- Loop via list till all the sum match the load ,  
4 - Because of Pmin ,  We are forced use  unecessary overflow of power , so during the loop we have to  ajust sometimes the power calculation for 02 successive powerplant 


# Design Pattern 

I use TDD with MSTest during the implmentantion with  Service , Converter , Dto  and  Strategy Pattern , each component in the app can injected and mocked with 
The Ioc Container , We can add easily a new Power Plant type without affecting the behavior of the other components 

Controller ->  Converter ( Dto ) - >  Service ( Model / Entity ) 
Controller <-  Converter ( Dto ) <-  Service ( Model / Entity )
